MTM316_Group4
=============

Repository for a Flash class project.

A simple graphic design program, giving the user the ability to create and edit basic shapes and text.
 Shapes can be dragged and scaled, potentially with the option to change the colors and rotate the shape.
 Editing of text would range in terms of changing the font size, font color, and font content, with a stretch
 goal of changing the font family. In addition to the more basic shapes and text, there will also be options 
 to draw arrows and lines, both with the added option of dragging and scaling and changing colors. Users will 
 have the ability to save, load, and delete files in local shared objects. Users can log in and out, and could 
 potentially save projects in the database so that they can edit them from other devices. There are multiple 
 stretch goals as well, including a layer functionality - similar to how Flash Pro or Photoshop works, a brush 
 tool with the ability to manipulate color and size, and a custom shape tool.
